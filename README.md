# CTI Stuffs - Threat Actor Usernames Scraped Edition

![CTI nerds vs threat actors](https://i.imgur.com/SP93Ph5.png)

A collection of CTI stuffs and various intel 📃 

I was inspired to make this because corpo threat intel companies are straight up absurd and charge 5-6 figures a year just to access this same type of data. I aint paying for that shit and oftentimes those of us in CTI cant get the needed budget approved for the tools we need/want so here we are. This is an ever changing and evolving repo that should (in theory) be updated oftenish so that it has fresh data.

If you have any neat fresh data or intel to add, submit a PR and throw it up baw.

If you are a researcher or cybercriminal who found your username in these lists, you should enable in the forum Settings to hide yourself when online and/or disable your acct from displaying in the Who's Online sections publicly. If you make posts on the forum, well no way to hide from that. Just make sure you use a username that is non-attributed to your other monikers or self. Also make sure to VPN and proxy up because you know law enforcement be getting their hands on these forums raw databases. Tons of nerds (like me) be scraping weird stuffs like this. 

I also have private scraped intel collections that I do not list here for various reasons. If you would like access to those, hit me up!
